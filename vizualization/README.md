# Visualizing solutions for Take It Easy

Open `main.html` in the web browser of choice (enable Javascript) and click `Browse...` to select a json file which contains a number of solutions in the format output by [`solve.py`](https://github.com/Dominik1123/Solver-for-TakeItEasy/blob/master/solve.py).

For navigating through the different solutions you can use

* the previous (`<`) and next (`>`) buttons,
* the arrow keys on your keyboard,

The total number of solutions is displayed in parentheses next to the current index.
